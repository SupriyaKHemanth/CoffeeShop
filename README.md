# CoffeeShop
Imagine a typical coffee shop scenario in which you have an attendant that takes customer orders at the counter and prepares their drinks. The customers sit in the shop and listen for their order to be called up. When their particular order is called up, they grab the drink and leave the store. If their order is not called they do not leave the store and continue to just sit there and listen for their order.
